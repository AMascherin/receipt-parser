# Intro
How many times did you go to the restaurant with your friends and every time you had trouble dividing the bill? What if there is an app that, with a simple photo, can support you?

# Receipt parser app

Repository for a simple Flutter application that I'm working on.
The goals for the final app are:
- From a photo of a receipt of a restaurant, bar,supermarket,etc. the app should be able to identify the products bought and the corresponding price
- Then it should provide the user a UI to help him split the bill with his friends
